# Amplify Mulesoft Anypoint Traceability Agent

## Prerequisites
Install the agent and provision Amplify Central access as described in [https://github.com/Axway/agents-mulesoft/blob/main/README.md](https://github.com/Axway/agents-mulesoft/blob/main/README.md).

- Amplify organization id
- Amplify Central environment name
- Pubic/Private key pem files
- Service account client id

As well as access to Amplify Central it is assumed you have access to the [Mulesoft Anypoint Platform](https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange). You need:

- Credentials with access to the organization the agents will attach to.
- Mulesoft environment name to discover from (e.g. Sandbox)


## Configuring the Traceability Agent

The agents read their configuration from a YAML file. To set up your config file copy the content of `default_mulesoft_traceability_agent.yml` into a new file named `mulesoft_traceability_agent`, and replace the default values that reflect your environment.

The minimial configuration for the agent is:

```
central:
  organizationID: <your organization id>
  environment: <your amplify environment name>
  auth:
    clientID: <your service account client id>
    privateKey: <path to your private_key.pem>
    publicKey: <path to your public_key.pem>

mulesoft:
 environment: <your Mulesoft environment>
 auth:
  username: <your Mulesoft username>
  password: <your Mulesoft password>
```

## Start the Traceability Agent

```
./mulesoft_traceability_agent --pathConfig <path to mulesoft_traceability_agent.yaml>
```

## Configuration Variables

- The following are all of the Environment variables that can be set, they will override the defaults
